# Book A Lawyer

> A React/Redux full-stack app for managing appointments with lawyers

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)


This repository is a React/Redux developed frontend app named "Book a lawyer App". The purpose of the project is to automate the law services. The Application allows an authenticated user to log in to the system, get a list of all available lawyers whose can be bookeed for a specified date and time. The lawyers' bio has the contact details, location, pricing per hour of the lawyer from which a user gets more insights. It also has dedicated pages to see the user's reservations and a reserve form. An admin user has the right to add/edit/remove a lawyer from the database and hence can see the Manage tab.

**Main features:**
- Account system, users can:
  - Create an account and provide an optional avatar.
  - Login to the app using email and password
  - Edit a personal account, users can modify his personal information.
- Reserve/booking system, users can:
  - Book an appointment with a lawyer on an incoming date, and set the appointment's duration.
  - See personal reservations in the reservation page.
  - Modify an existing reservation.
  - Cancel a reservation.
- Visualize details for a lawyer.
- Optimized for mobile devices.
